[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jferrettiboke/node-api-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jferrettiboke/node-api-boilerplate)

## Description

An API boilerplate with Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL and many more.

## Getting started

### Installation

Execute `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

### Directory structure

#### Introduction

The default directory structure is intended to provide a great starting point for both large and small applications. Of course, you are free to organize the directory structure however you like.

### Development environment

#### Start

Execute `npm run start` to run the development server on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** by default. You can pass whatever port you want, like `PORT=4000`.

After edit some files, you do not need to start the server again. Let to Nodemon do this for you.

#### Linting

Execute `npm run lint` on your terminal.

#### Testing

Execute `npm run test` on your terminal.

#### Test coverage

Execute `npm run test-cov` on your terminal.

#### Documentation

Execute `npm run doc` on your terminal to generate your own documentation based on your own code and files.

### Production environment

#### Build

Execute `npm run build` to compile the files.

Use `npm run clean` first if you have already created the *dist* folder and then execute `npm run build` to make sure it is a new full compilation.

#### Serve

Execute `npm run serve` to run the server and go to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. By default it will use port 3000, but you can pass whatever port you want, like `PORT=5000`.

## FAQs

### Why another JavaScript boilerplate?

There are many boilerplates over there, but this one is different. This one wants the best for your project. That means the last top technologies everytime. Easy to understand. Composable by other libraries that you want to add. And much more!

There is no any kind of magic. We look for the best technologies/libraries/approaches and we put them into this project that you can use for your projects then.

### Why does this project use everytime new technologies/libraries/approaches?

We love to be up to date and betting for good new technologies, libraries and approaches to get being faster, better and more productive. So, do not be scary about the change, that means innovation, productivity and being better. It will never change to worse, it will always change to be better.
